    <a href="https://open-weather.community"><i>Open-weather</i></a> is a feminist experiment in imagining and imagining the earth and its weather systems using DIY tools. Co-founded in 2020 by designer <span class="bio-name" id="sophie">Sophie Dyer</span> and geographer <span class="bio-name" id="sasha">Sasha Engelmann</span>, the collective produces artworks, workshops, and educational resources. From these activities a network of more than 100 DIY Satellite Ground Station operators, from Berlin to Buenos Aires, has grown around the project. In the tradition of intersectional feminism, open-weather investigates the politics of location and interlocking forms of oppression that shape our capacities to observe, negotiate, and respond to the climate crisis. In doing so, the collective challenges dominant representations of the Earth and environment while adding complexity to ideas around the weather beyond meteorology.
